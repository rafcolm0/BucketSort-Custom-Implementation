# BucketSort-Custom-Implementation
* Developer: Rafael J. Colon
* Custom implementation for the BucketSort ordering algorithm I submitted as an Android development assesment test.  

## Notes:
1) Code snippets actually written by me containing my algorithm can be found between the lines in the code snippet below from file MainActivity.java. The rest of the code was provided.
```
//TODO use the venue object to populate your recyclerview
... alrightm code...
//TOTAL RUNNING TIME (PART 1 & 2): T(n) =  O(2(n log n) + n) < O(n^2) -> WRONG, as submitted
//TOTAL RUNNING TIME (PART 1 & 2): T(n) =  O(2(n log n) + z), where z == final number of Person objects listed by the adapter
```
